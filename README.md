# 💻 Aditya's JavaScript Arena

A collection of all my JavaScript assignments and mini projects built during my learning journey.  
This is my personal coding playground — full of clicks, bugs, and breakthroughs!

## 🚀 What's Inside?

- 🔘 Greeting popups
- 🎲 Coin Flip Game
- ✂️ Rock Paper Scissors
- 🛒 Cart logic with quantity buttons
- 📺 YouTube-style Subscribe button
- 🎁 Birthday Surprise Site for Mom (coming soon)

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to keep all my YouTube course projects in one place, track my progress, and slowly build my confidence in HTML/CSS/JS.  
Also, because copying-pasting in one file is easier than finding them in 10 folders 😅

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (basic styling & animations)  
- JavaScript (DOM, events, localStorage)



## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning repo — but feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or just say hi!
